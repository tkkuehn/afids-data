##Curated anatomical landmarks placements for common neuroimaging datasets

In this GitHub repository, you can find: 

1) Markups Comma-separated values file (i.e., *.fcsv extension) files for both templates and datasets (along side template scans if size permits; otherwise *coordinate.json will have instructions for download). 
2) Jupyter notebooks involved in creation of the JavaScript Object Notation (i.e., *.json) which is an adaptation from BIDS Appendix VIII on Coordinate systems.  
3) Information about rater experience and background 

Compressed NIfTI-1 format (i.e., .nii.gz extension) for datasets involved in this study are availible on OpenNeuro: 

1) Seterotactic Neurosurgery Healthy Control Dataset (SNSX; n = 32): 
2) London Health Sciences Center Parkinson's Disease Dataset (LHSC-PD ; n = 40): 
3) 100 Unrelated Humman Connectome Project subset (HCP; n = 30): 
4) Open Access Series of Imaging Studies subset (OASIS; n = 30):
