# afids-data 
Magnetic resonance imaging datasets with anatomical fiducials for quality control and registration

## In this GitHub repo, you can find: 

1) Markups Comma-separated values file (i.e., *.fcsv extension) files for both templates and datasets (along side template scans if size permits; otherwise *coordinate.json will have instructions for download). 
2) Jupyter notebooks involved in creation of the JavaScript Object Notation (i.e., *.json) which is an adaptation from BIDS Appendix VIII on Coordinate systems.  
3) Information about rater experience and background 

## Compressed NIfTI-1 format (i.e., .nii.gz extension) for datasets involved in this study are available on OpenNeuro:
